## Discription
**Textmage** is a website that generate images from text using generative model called - **DALLE**. **DALLE** is released from **OpenAI**. Here is the [paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12092). The model was built from the [
Phil Wang](https://github.com/lucidrains) repository - [DALLE-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE-pytorch).


## Install and deploy
1. Create an virtual environment using **conda** or **virtualenv**.
2. Install **requirement.txt**
    ```shell
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Used package are shown [here](https://github.com/JoyPang123/Textmage/blob/main/requirements.txt).
3. Download the pretrained weight  
    Users can download the weight from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sRinsRKxKaWHhRJ3ayT60BTHDANTQuQg/view?usp=sharing). Or using `gdown` to download the file (recommend). Download file should be placed in the **root** of the project folder.
    ```shell
    $ cd Textmage
    $ gdown https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1sRinsRKxKaWHhRJ3ayT60BTHDANTQuQg
    $ unzip -q weight.zip && rm weight.zip
    ```
5. Deploy
    ```shell
    $ python app.py
    ```
    
## Dataset

> Note: Training images and text should be placed in the same folder


### COCO Dataset
To train on COCO dataset, run the following command:
```shell
$ ./tools/coco_dataset/download_images.sh
```
All the downloaded files will be placed in `tools/coco_dataset/dataset`:
```
tools/coco_dataset/dataset
|
|--train2017
|
|--val2017
|
|--annotations
```

To download text, run the `tools/coco_dataset/download_text.py`. Usage is shown below
```shell
usage: download_text.py [-h] [-c COCO] [-d DOWNLOAD] [-t IMAGE_TYPE] -p PLACE

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c COCO, --coco COCO  Root dir for the coco json files
  -d DOWNLOAD, --download DOWNLOAD
                        Download the annotation files
  -t IMAGE_TYPE, --image_type IMAGE_TYPE
                        Types for the image - train and val
  -p PLACE, --place PLACE
                        Place for download files
```
For example
```shell
$ cd tool/coco_dataset
$ python download_text.py \
    --coco dataset/annotations/ \
    --downlaod false \
    --image_type train \
    --place dataset/train2017
```

### Icon
> Warning: The icon were downloaded from the [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com). Please follow their rules to avoid any legal dispute. In our examples and our project, we only download their free icons


Users can first find the [icon packs](https://www.flaticon.com/packs) you like and copy the **url** into `tools/crawler/categories.txt` and use `,` to seperate text. For example, I downloaded cat icons and expect all the icons to be labeled to `cat`:
```
https://...,cat
```

See [categories.txt](https://github.com/JoyPang123/Textmage/blob/main/tools/crawler/categroies.txt) for more example.

Afterwards, run `tools/crawler/get-icon.py` to download the text-image pairs. Usage of `get-icon.py` is shown below
```
usage: get-icon.py [-h] -w WEBSITE -o OUTPUT

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TXT, --txt TXT
                        Txt file for downloading a pack of icons
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output directory for the download
```

For instance:

```shell
$ cd tools/crawler
$ python get-icon.py \
    --txt categories.txt \
    --output dataset
```

## Training
For training custom model, please refer to the [DALLE-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/DALLE-pytorch). Above dataset can be used in training.

## Demonstration
### 1. On COCO dataset
```
Two dogs are standing on the surf board
```

```
Sheep is flying in the air
```

> Well, our model is not good enough...

### 2. On Icon dataset
```
dog
```

```
cat
```
![](https://i.imgur.com/osC7TqS.jpg)

> It learned only on the training dataset... Because we only collect 566 icons...

What if we tried dog + cat?

```
dog cat
```
